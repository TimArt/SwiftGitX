# SwiftGitX

Welcome to SwiftGitX! ðŸŽ‰

SwiftGitX provides modern Swift bindings to [libgit2](https://libgit2.org). It's designed to make working with Git in Swift easy and efficient. Plus, it fully supports the [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager) and has no external dependencies.

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://github.com/ibrahimcetin/SwiftGitX.git")!
let repository = try await Repository.clone(from: url, to: URL(string: "/path/to/clone")!)

let latestCommit = try repository.HEAD.target as? Commit

let main = try repository.branch.get(named: "main")
let feature = try repository.branch.create(named: "feature", from: main)
try repository.switch(to: feature)
```
